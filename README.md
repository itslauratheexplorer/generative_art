# Generative Artwork
This Python script enables to creates generative art images by combining random shapes, a images, and text on a colorful background. Right now the script is modifiied to create colorful rectangles, a star image and song quotes on randomly changing colorful backgrounds.
The python file is called "generative_gracie_artwork" since the used quotes and image are references to singer Gracie Abrams. There for my code and the generated art works are based on her and her music. 
(But the code is editable as desired)
